A database is a logically organized collection of structured data kept electronically in a computer system. A database management system is usually in charge of a database. Databases are collections of organized data that can be accessed, maintained, and updated with ease. Because they communicate information about your sales transactions, product inventory, customer profiles, and marketing efforts, database systems are critical to your business.
